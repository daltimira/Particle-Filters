In this project you will implement a 2 dimensional particle filter in C++. Your particle filter will be given a map and some initial localization information (analogous to what a GPS would provide). At each time step your filter will also get observation and control data.

Included in the Kidnapped Vehicle project Github repository are program files that allow you to set up and run c++ uWebSocketIO, which is used to communicate with the simulator. The simulator provides the script for the noisy position data, vehicle controls, and noisy observations. The script feeds back the best particle state.

The simulator can also display the best particle's sensed positions, along with the corresponding map ID associations. This can be extremely helpful to make sure transition and association calculations were done correctly. 

Running the Program

Download the simulator and open it. In the main menu screen select Project 3: Kidnapped Vehicle.

Once the scene is loaded you can hit the START button to observe how the car drives and observes landmarks. At any time you can press the PAUSE button, to pause the scene or hit the RESTART button to reset the scene. Also the ARROW KEYS can be used to move the camera around, and the top left ZOOM IN/OUT buttons can be used to focus the camera. Pressing the ESCAPE KEY returns to the simulator main menu.

The Kidnapped Vehicle project Github repository README has more detailed instructions for installing and using c++ uWebScoketIO.
